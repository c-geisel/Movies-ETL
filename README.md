## Summary 
Amazing Prime is a platform that streams TV and movies. The platform wants to predict what videos will be popular so that they can stream the videos on their platform. To do this, a clean dataset must be provided. This analysis creates an automated pipeline that takes in data, applies transformations, then loads data into tables. To do this, one function is made to take in three files, perform the ETL process on it, and then load the information into SQL.
